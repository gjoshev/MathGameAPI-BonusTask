## Description

This is a simple real-time math game where:

- Players receive math questions via SignalR.
- They input their answers and submit them.
- The result is broadcasted to all connected clients with feedback on whether the answer was correct or not.
- New questions are automatically generated and sent to all clients once an answer is submitted.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication:** Uses **SignalR** to provide real-time updates for new questions and answer results.
- **Math Game Mechanics:** Displays math expressions and checks user answers.
- **Answer Validation:** Users' answers are validated, and feedback is given on whether they were correct or incorrect.
- **React Frontend:** The app uses React for the frontend to handle UI and state management efficiently.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** SignalR Hub (for handling communication)
  - ASP.NET Core SignalR (backend setup for real-time communication)
